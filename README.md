# AI-Driven Cloud-Agnostic Threat Detection System  

## Project Overview  
This project aims to develop an **AI-powered cloud-agnostic threat detection system** that identifies security anomalies using machine learning. The system processes security logs from different environments and applies AI to detect threats in real time.  

## Goals & Objectives  
Develop a **cloud-agnostic** threat detection system.  
Use **machine learning models** for anomaly detection.  
Process **security logs** from open-source datasets.  
Provide **real-time alerts** for detected threats.  
Build a **dashboard** for visualization.
